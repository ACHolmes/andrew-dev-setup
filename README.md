# andrew-dev-setup

This is a repository to store as much information as possible regarding my local development setup. The purpose of this is to keep help me organize what tools I am using, especially for when I move machines or operating systems. 

It may also be a tool for some of my students to use as they configure their system to their liking if there are tools or setup details that they like from my setup. Note that this is likely not to be well maintained, as in reality I'm unlikely to update this everytime I install a new plugin or similar, but hopefully it will be enough to speed up setting up again in the future sufficiently to be worth it.

As of Jan 2024, this is very much a work in progress. This repository will likely receive a few updates in the next few months as I continue experimenting with what tools I like best.
